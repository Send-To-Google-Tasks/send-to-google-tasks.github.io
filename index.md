### Why Google API Permissions are required

While this application only runs within your chrome browser, Google API requires the application to access your data via OAuth access token. That means whoever have access to your token can access your data on your behalf. We keep your token inside the chrome browser. The permission that is granted is Google Tasks API write permissions, which is required to write to Google Tasks.
